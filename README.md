### Functional Requirements

| 1. Appointment Scheduling Time | Administrative staff should be able to schedule a complete psychology consultation appointment in less than five minutes, provided that all necessary information is available. |
| 2. Visibility of Main Functions | The main screen should clearly display the essential actions, such as creating, editing, or canceling appointments, without requiring unnecessary navigation. |
| 3. Required Field Validation | The system should ensure that all required information is completed before allowing an appointment to be saved. |
| 4. Prevention of Scheduling Conflicts | The system should prevent double-booking by ensuring that a psychologist cannot be assigned to more than one appointment at the same date and time. |
| 5. Clear Error Messages | When an error occurs, the system should clearly explain what went wrong and guide the user on how to correct it, using simple and understandable language. |
| 6. Readable Text and Visual Comfort | The interface should use text that is easy to read, with an appropriate font size and clear contrast, suitable for users across different age ranges. |
| 7. Keyboard Accessibility | Users should be able to complete all main tasks using only the keyboard, without depending entirely on a mouse. |
| 8. Simple and Non-Technical Language | The system should use clear, everyday language related to administrative tasks in psychology services, avoiding technical or system-related terminology. |
| 9. Clear Confirmation of Actions | After successfully completing an action, such as creating or updating an appointment, the system should provide a clear visual confirmation. |
| 10. Standard Date Format | All dates should be displayed and entered using the local format (dd/mm/yyyy) to avoid confusion. |
